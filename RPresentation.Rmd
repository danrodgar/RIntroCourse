The goal of the first part of this book is to get you up to speed with the basics of __R__ as quickly as possible.

# Installation 
  
Follow the procedures according to your operating system.

  * Linux: You need to have `blas` and `gfortran` installed on your Linux, for installing the `coin` package.
  * _Rgraphviz_ requires installation from  `source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")`, then `biocLite("Rgraphviz")`.
  * Uncomment the following lines for installing all missing packages (this will take some time):



# R and RStudio
  * R is a programming language for statistical computing and data analysis that supports a variety of programming styles. See [R in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
  * R has multiple online resources and books.
  * [R coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
  * [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)

# Examples 

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)   # Create ordered collection (vector)
y <- x^2              # Square the elements of x
print(y)              # print (vector) y
mean(y)               # Calculate average (arithmetic mean) of (vector) y; result is scalar
var(y)                # Calculate sample variance
lm_1 <- lm(y ~ x)     # Fit a linear regression model "y = f(x)" or "y = B0 + (B1 * x)"
                      # store the results as lm_1
print(lm_1)           # Print the model from the (linear model object) lm_1
summary(lm_1)         # Compute and print statistics for the fit
                      # of the (linear model object) lm_1
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))    # Request 2x2 plot layout
plot(lm_1)            # Diagnostic plot of regression model
